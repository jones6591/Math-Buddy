# Math-Buddy
We are creating a children friendly calculator!

Project Idea Marcus Jones &amp; Jacob Colver

As a kid there were a few things that I absolutely could not stand. Eating my vegetables, going to bed on time, and most of all; trying to navigate the wide world of mathematics. Math seems to be one of those things that you either &quot;just get&quot; or you don&#39;t and for most of my life I just didn&#39;t get it! When speaking to tutors or friends who may have been helping me out with any sort of arithmetic issues the consensus answer to how they developed their mathematical skills and they all said the same thing &quot;I started early&quot; when I was in elementary school, math was comprised of worksheets from a book, homework that I would sit at the kitchen table doing all night and of course my favorite, flash cards. All of these things are painstakingly boring and as a kid just keeping your attention on one thing is a task in itself, but with new technology I began to think &quot;what if math could be fun? And with that thought we decided to create Math Buddy!

Math Buddy is a program created for kids, providing a fun and easy to learn way to solve math equations. Math Buddy will also have a user friendly interface that is geared for all kids who are learning simple math. This software specifically makes math fun for kids by involving them in a math based atmosphere that they can easily relate to. Math Buddy will be implemented with a preexisting kid friendly graphical user interface that allows them access to efficient problem solving. Math Buddy will be able to solve various math equations derived from integer user inputs which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the user enters their integer and math problem type they will be presented with a direct solution to their respective input.

There will be two people involved in this project; Marcus Jones and Jacob Colver. Both of us will be participating in the coding and the report portions of this project therefore the work will be split up evenly.
